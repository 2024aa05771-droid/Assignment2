Problem statement :

In this assignment, you will be required to:

1. Implement multiple classification models

2. Develop an interactive Streamlit web application to showcase your models

3. Deploy the application on Streamlit Community Cloud (free)

4. Provide clickable links for evaluation

Through this task, you will gain hands-on experience with a real-world, end-to-end machine learning deployment workflow, including model development, evaluation, user interface design, and deployment.


About Dataset

Background

Enzymes are known to act on molecules with structural similarities with their substrates. This behaviour is called promiscuity. Scientists working in drug discovery use this behaviour to target/design drugs to either block or promote biological actions. But, correct 

prediction of EC class(s) of substrates associated with enzymes has been a challenge in biology. Since there is no shortage of data, ML techniques can be employed to solve the aforementioned problem.

Points to keep in mind

Substrate molecules can belong to multiple EC-Classes at the same time as same molecules participate in different types of reactions in biology Dataset is highly imbalanced in labels need an algorithm that can tackle label imbalance Smallest label count is 1 and highest 

label count is 248

Content

There are 3 files names mixed_(desc, ecfp, fcfp).csv containing chemical, structural, connectivity information.
